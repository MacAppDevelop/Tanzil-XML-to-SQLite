# Convert XML files from Tanzil.net to SQLite import files

This application is used to convert XML files [downloaded from Tanzil.net](https://tanzil.net/download/) into SQLite import files.

It also applies the following in the process of converting:

- Adds Bismillah with Aya #0 to all Surahs (except to Al-Fatiha and at-Tawbah)
- Each row will have surahNumber, ayaNumber and text (Primary key is composite surahNumber, ayaNumber)

The reason we don't just use SQL (MySQL Dumps) files from Tanzil directly, is because all of them include Bismillah in the first Aya's text, searching and replacing it risks some unwanted changes.
